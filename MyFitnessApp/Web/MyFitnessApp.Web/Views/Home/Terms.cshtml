            jurisdictions). No individual under the age of 18 may use the Services,

                and it's important that you keep your account accurate and up-to-date
                (particularly your email address - if you ever forget your password, a
                working email address is often the only way for us to verify your
                identity and help you log back in).
            </em>
        </p><p>
            You may need to register for a MyFittnesApp account to access or use
            certain Services. Your account may also automatically provide you access
            and means to use any new Services.
        </p><p>
            When you create an account for any of our Services, you must provide us
            with accurate and complete information as prompted by the account
            creation and registration process, and keep that information up to date.
            Otherwise, some of our Services may not operate correctly, and we may
            not be able to contact you with important notices.
        </p><p>
            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any and all
            actions that take place while using your account, and must notify
            our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.MyFittnesApp.com/contact-us">Support Team</a>&nbsp;right away

            results from unauthorized use of your username and password.

        </p><h3>1.3 Service Updates, Changes and Limitations</h3><p>
            <em>
                Our Services are constantly evolving. With the launch of new products,
                services, and features, we need the flexibility to make changes, impose
                limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain Services. We may
                also update our Services, which might not work properly if you don't
                install the updates.
            </em>
        </p><p>
            The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may
            change without prior notice to you.
        </p><p>
            We may provide updates (including automatic updates) for certain
            Services as and when we see fit. This may include upgrades,
            modifications, bug fixes, patches and other error corrections and/or new
            features (collectively,&nbsp;<strong>“Updates”</strong>). Certain portions of our Services
            may not properly operate if you do not install all Updates. You
            acknowledge and agree that the Services may not work properly if you do
            not allow such Updates and you expressly consent to automatic Updates.
            Further, you agree that the Terms (and any additional modifications of
            the same) will apply to any and all Updates to the Services. We may
            change, suspend, or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time,
            including the availability of any product, feature, database, or
            Content. In addition, we have no obligation to provide any Updates or to
            continue to provide or enable any particular features or functionality
            of any Service. We may also impose limits on certain Services or
            restrict your access to part or all of the Services without notice or
            liability.
        </p><h3>1.4 Service Monitoring and Suspension</h3><p>
            <em>
                We reserve the right to refuse to provide the Services to anyone, and
                can monitor, terminate or suspend your account or access to the Services
                at any time.
            </em>
        </p><p>
            We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor any accounts
            and/or activities conducted through or in any way related to the
            Services (including inviting a fellow user into a community or group),
            as well as any user’s use of or access to Personal Data, and profiles of
            other users.
        </p><p>
            We may also deactivate, terminate or suspend your account or access to
            certain Services at any time: (1) if we, in our sole discretion,
            determine you are or have been in violation of these Terms or the spirit
            thereof (as highlighted in our Community Guidelines), (2) if we, in our
            sole discretion, determine you have created risk or possible legal
            exposure for MyFittnesApp, the general public, any third party, or any
            user of our Services, (3) in response to requests by law enforcement or
            other government agencies, (4) upon discontinuation or material
            modification of any Services, or (5) due to unexpected technical issues
            or problems. We will endeavor to notify you by email or the next time
            you attempt to access your account after any such deactivation,
            termination or suspension.

                Our Services often contain community features. When you post content
                through these features that content may become public. We may, but do

        </p><p>
            Some of our Services may include reviews, discussion forums,
            conversation pages, blogs or other interactive areas or social features
            that allow you and other users to post User-Generated Content and
            interact with one another (<strong>“Interactive Areas”</strong>). You are solely
            responsible for your use of the Interactive Areas and for any
            User-Generated Content you post, including the transmission, accuracy
            and completeness of the User-Generated Content. As the Interactive Areas
            are often public, you understand your User-Generated Content may be made
            and remain public. You should, accordingly, never post any Personal Data
            in an Interactive Area.
        </p><p>
            We are entitled, but have no obligation, to monitor our community
            features. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other

            comments, challenges, and friendly competition. We assume no
            responsibility or liability for any loss or damage resulting from any
            interaction with other users who employ the Services, individuals you
            meet through the Services, or individuals who find you because of
            Content posted on, by or through the Services. MyFittnesApp is under no
            obligation to become involved in and disclaims all liability related to
            any disputes between its users and you release MyFittnesApp from all

            dispute.

            Services. Our Community Guidelines are based in many instances on
            principles of applicable law. Violations of our Community Guidelines may
            expose you to criminal charges and civil liability. By using the
            Services you agree that your User-Generated Content and use of the
            Services, including without limitation the Interactive Areas, will not
            violate the Community Guidelines. If you violate the Community

        </p><h3>6.1 Wireless Carrier and Device Considerations</h3><p>
            To use or access our App, you will need a compatible device. We cannot
            guarantee the App will be compatible with, or available on, your device.
            We do not charge for use of the App. Your phone company’s normal
            messaging, data, and other rates and fees, however, will still apply.
            You may be required pay fees to access certain special features and
            content included in our Premium Subscriptions (as described in Section
            7).

            We hereby grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive,

                    acceptance of these Terms, the App Provider will have the right (and
                    will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as
                    related to your license of the App against you as a third-party

            <em>
                If you choose to subscribe to any of our enhanced, paid services like
                our Premium Subscriptions, these are the payment and billing terms that
                apply. Paid services and billing may auto-renew unless you cancel. You
                may cancel at any time.
            </em>
        </p><h3>7.1 Payment Terms</h3><p>
            We offer certain premium versions of the Services (e.g., Premium
            Subscriptions) (the&nbsp;<strong>“Premium Services”</strong>) for a fee. By signing up for
            and using the Premium Services, you agree to our Terms, and any
            additional terms and conditions provided here. You also agree to waive
            your 14-day right of withdrawal at the moment you subscribe to the
            Premium Services to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, so
            that you are able to immediately access them.
        </p><p>
            The Premium Services provide you access to certain enhanced content,
            features and functionality (e.g., setting macros by grams, an ad-free
            experience and per day ). By signing up for and using the Premium
            Services, including signing up for Free Trials of the Premium Services,
            you agree to pay any fees or other incurred charges that apply to the
            Premium Services (such as ongoing subscription fees).
        </p><p>
            When you sign up for the Premium Services, you must designate and
            provide information about your preferred payment method (<strong>
                “Payment
                Method”
            </strong>). This information must be complete and accurate, and you are
            responsible for keeping it up to date. You expressly authorize us to
            collect via automatic debit or ACH from your Payment Method the
            appropriate fees charged for the Premium Services and for any other
            purchases you elect to make via the Services.
        </p><p>
            You can choose to pay for the Premium Services on a monthly or annual
            basis. Unless otherwise stated, all fees due for the Premium Services
            are payable in advance, and will be billed automatically to the Payment
            Method at the start of the monthly or annual Premium Service period, as
            applicable. Unless otherwise stated, Premium Services will auto-renew
            until you elect to cancel your access to Premium Services. All purchases
            of Premium Services are final and non-refundable, except at our sole
            discretion and in accordance with the rules governing each Premium
            Service.
        </p><h3>7.2 Termination or Cancellation of Premium Services</h3><p>
            If you do not pay the fees or charges due for your use of the Premium
            Services, we may make reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve the
            issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or terminate your access
            to the Premium Services (and may do so without notice).
        </p><p>
            You can cancel the Premium Services at any time. More information on how
            to cancel can be
            found&nbsp;<a href="https://MyFittnesApp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032625371-How-do-I-cancel-my-Premium-subscription-renewal">here</a>.
            Once you have cancelled your Premium Service and received confirmation,
            no other changes can be made to your account. The cancellation of a
            Premium Service will go into effect at the end of your current billing
            cycle, and you will have the same level of access to the Premium Service
            through the remainder of such billing cycle. For example, if you are
            billed on a monthly basis and cancel during a given month, you will be
            charged for the entirety of that month and maintain access to the
            Premium Service through the end of that month.
        </p><p>
            There are no refunds for termination or cancellation of your Premium
            Service. If you no longer wish to subscribe to a Premium Service, it is
            your responsibility to cancel your Premium Service in due time,
            regardless of whether or not you actively use the Premium Service.
        </p><h3>7.3 Fee Changes</h3><p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change our
            prices for Premium Services at any time. We will give you reasonable
            notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or
            through the applicable Premium Service and/or by sending you an email
            notification. If you do not wish to pay the new prices, you can cancel
            the applicable Premium Service prior to the change going into effect.
        </p><h3>7.4 Discount, Coupon or Gift Codes</h3><p>
            If you have received a discount, coupon or gift code to a Premium
            Service, the following terms and conditions apply in addition to the
            terms and conditions of the specific code. To redeem a discount or
            coupon code, log in to MyFittnesApp and enter the applicable code to
            take advantage of the relevant promotion. All discounts, gift and coupon
            codes can only be applied when subscribing to Premium Services, and to
            accounts not already subscribed to Premium Services. Discount, coupon
            and gift codes cannot be combined with any other sales, promotion or
            coupon, and cannot be exchanged, refunded, replaced or redeemed for cash
            or payment of accounts. A payment method may be required to redeem a
            discount or coupon code. It is your own responsibility to use a
            discount, coupon or gift code before it expires, and expired codes
            cannot be refunded or extended. It is also your responsibility to
            terminate the Premium Service before the end of a free or discounted
            period if you do not want to continue with a Premium Service at the
            regular price. The terms and conditions of a specific discount, coupon
            or gift code may include additional restrictions on its use, including
            but not limited to the type of plan, duration of free or discounted
            Premium Service, coupon validity dates, and/or purchase quantities.
            MyFittnesApp reserves the right to cancel discounts and coupon
            promotions at any time.
        </p><h3>7.5 Free Trials</h3><p>
            We sometimes offer free trials of our Premium Services or other
            promotional offers (each a&nbsp;<strong>“Free Trial”</strong>). A Free Trial provides you
            access to the Premium Services for a period of time, with details
            specified when you sign up for the offer.
        </p><p>
            In order to sign up for a Free Trial, you may need to provide us with
            your preferred Payment Method. As soon as you submit your payment
            details, your Free Trial will begin. You will not be charged until the
            Free Trial period ends.
        </p><p>
            <strong>
                Unless you cancel before the end of the Free Trial, or unless
                otherwise stated, your access to the Premium Service will automatically
                continue and you will be billed the applicable fees for that Premium
                Service using the Payment Method you provided.
            </strong>&nbsp;All incurred charges
            are final and non-refundable, except at our sole discretion and in
            accordance with the rules governing each Premium Service. We may send
            you a reminder when your Free Trial is about to end, but we do not
            guarantee any such notifications. It is ultimately your responsibility
            to know when the Free Trial will end if you decide you do not want to
            become a paying Premium Services user after the Free Trial period.
        </p><p>
            If you decide you do not want to become a paying Premium Services user,
            you must cancel your subscription before the end of the Free Trial

                It's important to us that users stay healthy while achieving their
                fitness and wellness goals. Please be responsible and use your best

        </p><h3>8.1 Safety First</h3><p>
            MyFittnesApp cares about your safety. You should consult with your
            healthcare provider(s) and consider the associated risks before using
            our Services in connection with any fitness or wellness regimen-oriented
            Content or any dietary program-oriented Content (“<strong>Programs</strong>”). By
            using our Services, you agree, represent and warrant that you have
            received consent from your physician to participate in the Programs, or
            any of the related activities made available to you in connection with
            the Services. Further, you agree, represent and warrant that you have
            consulted with your physician before making any dietary changes based
            upon information available through the Services. Everyone’s condition
            and abilities are different, and participating in the Programs and other
            activities promoted by our Services is at your own risk. If you choose
            to participate in the Programs and these activities, you do so of your
            own free will and accord, knowingly and voluntarily assuming all risks
            associated with such activities. The Programs and other activities
            promoted by the Services may pose risks even to those who are currently
            in good health.

            You expressly agree that your athletic activities, which may generate
            the User-Generated Content you post or seek to post on or via the
            Services (e.g., workouts exercises, etc.) carry certain inherent and
            significant risks of property damage, bodily injury, or death and that
            you voluntarily assume all known and unknown risks associated with these
            activities.

            We make no representations or warranties as to the accuracy,
            reliability, completeness or timeliness of any Content available through
            the Services, and we make no commitment to update such Content.

            In addition, User-Generated Content, including advice, statements, or
            other information, including, without limitation, food, nutrition,
            dietary guidance, exercise or training guidance, athletic activities,
            and exercise database entries, are not produced by MyFittnesApp, and
            should not be relied on without independent verification. User-Generated
            Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole
            responsibility of the user from whom such User-Generated Content
            originated. All information is provided “as is” without any
            representation, warranty or condition as to its accuracy or reliability.
        </p><p>
            In particular, MyFittnesApp’s food database (<strong>“Food Database”</strong>)
            contains a combination of nutritional information entered by
            MyFittnesApp and MyFittnesApp members. Any user of the Services can
            contribute to or edit nutritional information in the Food Database.
            Please be advised that nutritional information in the Food Database has
            not been reviewed by persons with the expertise required to provide you
            with complete, accurate, or reliable information. MyFittnesApp does not
            (i) guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any
            nutritional information or ingredients in the Food Database; or (ii)
            adopt, endorse or accept responsibility for the accuracy or reliability
            of any such nutritional information. To the extent permitted by
            applicable law, under no circumstances will MyFittnesApp be responsible
            for any loss or damage resulting from your reliance on nutritional
            information. You are solely responsible for ensuring any nutritional
            information in the Food Database is accurate, complete and useful.

            Not all users who may identify themselves as professional trainers or
            licensed dieticians are licensed in all applicable jurisdictions.
            MyFittnesApp has no and assumes no obligation to verify that users who
            identify themselves as licensed trainers or dieticians are actually
            licensed. If you hold yourself out as a licensed trainer or dietician,
            you represent and warrant that you are actually licensed for the
            services you provide in the jurisdiction in which you offer your
            services. Users should also bear in mind that even if a user is a
            licensed trainer in one jurisdiction that does not mean the trainer user
            is licensed in the jurisdiction from which other users access the
            trainer user’s advice. Accordingly, relying on any advice provided by
            other users is at your own risk. To the extent permitted by applicable
            law, under no circumstances will MyFittnesApp be responsible or liable
            for any loss or damage resulting from your reliance on information or
            advice provided by any user of our Services.
        </p><h3>8.3 Not Medical Advice</h3><p>
            Any and all services provided by, in and/or through the Services
            (including but not limited to Content) are for informational purposes
            only. MyFittnesApp is not a medical professional, and MyFittnesApp does
            not provide medical services or render medical advice. Nothing contained
            in the Services should be construed as such advice or diagnosis. The
            information and reports generated by us should not be interpreted as a
            substitute for physician consultation, evaluation, or treatment, and the
            information made available on or through the Services should not be
            relied upon when making medical decisions, or to diagnose or treat a
            health condition or illness. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT CREATE A
            DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND MyFittnesApp.
        </p><p>
            You should seek the advice of a physician or a medical professional with
            any questions you may have regarding your health before beginning any
            dietary programs or plans, exercise regimen or any other fitness or
            wellness activities or plans that may be referenced, discussed or
            offered under the Services. If you are being treated for a health
            condition or illness, taking prescription medication or following a
            therapeutic diet to treat a disease, you should consult with your
            physician before using the Services. You represent to us (which
            representation shall be deemed to be made each time you use the
            Services), that you are not using the Services or participating in any
            of the activities offered by the Services for purpose of seeking medical
            attention. You further agree that, before using the Services, you will
            consult your physician, particularly if you are at risk for problems
            resulting from exercise or changes in your diet. If any information you
            receive or obtain from using the Services is inconsistent with the
            medical advice from your physician, you should follow the advice of your
            physician.
        </p><p>
            The Premium Services provide you access to certain specialized
            Content—namely coaching and guidance on fitness regimens and meal
            planning (“<strong>Plans</strong>”). The Plans are not a medical or any other type of
            health service. No diagnosis or treatment of, or advice regarding, any
            dietary or health condition is delivered by the Plans. The Plans are not
            a substitute for, and are not an alternative to healthcare diagnosis and
            treatment when a dietary or health condition or illness is present. You
            should seek diagnosis, treatment and advice regarding dietary or health
            conditions or illnesses from physicians practicing medicine and other
            licensed healthcare professionals. Under no circumstances will any of
            your interactions with our Plans be deemed or construed to create a
            physician-patient relationship or a fiduciary duty of any kind
            whatsoever. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE
            PLANS.
        </p><h3>8.4 Success Stories Not Typical</h3><p>
            Success stories posted by users or MyFittnesApp on our Services may not
            represent typical or even accurate results obtained from any particular
            fitness activity or diet. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
            MyFittnesApp has no and assumes no obligation or liability associated
            with the accuracy, reliability or effectiveness of any fitness activity
            or dietary recommendation contained in any user success stories.
        </p><h3>8.5 Accuracy</h3><p>
            The Services are intended to provide you with information to encourage
            you to support your wellness and fitness activities. Some of the
            Services are aimed at tracking your physical movements and sleep
            activity (<strong>“Activity Tracking Services”</strong>). These Activity Tracking
            Services rely on sensors and/or GPS functionality that track your
            movement or body at rest. The data and information provided by the
            Activity Tracking Services are intended to be a representation of your
            activity, but may not be completely accurate, including with respect to
            step, sleep, distance, or calorie data. By using Activity Tracking
            Services, you acknowledge and agree that MyFittnesApp is not responsible
            or liable for any inaccuracy in such data.
        </p><p><strong>If you are a resident of New Jersey or the Netherlands:</strong></p><p>
            Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in these Terms
            limits or excludes our responsibility for losses or damages caused by
            MyFittnesApp’s own fraud, recklessness, gross negligence or willful
            misconduct.
        </p><h2>9. Modifications to the Terms</h2><p>
            <em>
                As the Services grow and improve, we might have to make changes to
                these Terms.
            </em>
        </p><h3>9.1 Updates to these Terms</h3><p>
            We reserve the right to modify these Terms by (i) posting revised Terms
            on and/or through the Services, and/or (ii) providing advance notice to
            you of material changes to the Terms, generally via email where
            practicable, and otherwise through the Services (such as through a
            notification on the home page of the MyFittnesApp website or in -app).
            Modifications will not apply retroactively unless required by law.
        </p><p>
            We may sometimes ask you to review and to explicitly agree to or reject
            a revised version of the Terms. In such cases, modifications will be
            effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of the
            Terms. If you do not agree at that time, you are not permitted to use
            the Services. In cases where we do not ask for your explicit agreement
            to a modified version of the Terms, the modified version of the Terms
            will become effective as of the date specified in the Terms. Your choice
            to maintain an account, access or use the Services (regardless of
            whether you create an account with us) following that date constitutes
            your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Terms as modified. If
            you do not agree to the modifications, you are not permitted to use, and
            should discontinue your use of, the Services.

            EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, MyFittnesApp EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
            WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER ORAL OR

            PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
            PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE LAW. THE SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON
            AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITH ALL FAULTS BASIS. Without limiting
            the foregoing, you understand that, to the maximum extent permitted by
            applicable law, we make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy,
            timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, availability, or reliability of
            any of the Services or any Content. To the maximum extent permitted by
            applicable law, we do not warrant that (i) the Services will meet your
            requirements or provide specific results, (ii) the operation of the
            Services will be uninterrupted, virus- or error-free or free from other
            harmful elements or (iii) errors will be corrected. Any oral or written
            advice provided by our agents or us does not and will not create any
            warranty. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we also
            make no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to any
            Content; User-Generated Content, in particular, is provided by and is
            solely the responsibility of the users providing that Content. No advice
            or information, whether oral or written, obtained from other users or
            through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made
            herein. You therefore expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the
            Services is at your sole risk and that the entire risk as to
            satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy and effort is with you.

            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, under no
            circumstances (including, without limitation, negligence) shall
            MyFittnesApp, its subsidiaries, partners or any wireless carriers be
            liable to you or any third party for (a) any indirect, incidental,
            special, reliance, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages of any

            theory, whether or not MyFittnesApp has been informed of the possibility
            of such damage, and further where a remedy set forth herein is found to
            have failed its essential purpose. To the maximum extent permitted by
            applicable law, the total liability of MyFittnesApp, for any claim under
            these Terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the
            greater of five hundred dollars (us $500.00) or the amount you paid us

            the warranty disclaimers, releases, and limitations of liability set
            forth in the Terms, that these warranty disclaimers, releases, and
            limitations of liability reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of
            risk between you and form an essential basis of the bargain between you
            and us. We would not be able to provide the Services to you on an
            economically reasonable basis without these warranty disclaimers,
            releases, and limitations of liability.

                If you are a resident of the United States or any non-European Union
                location:
            </strong>&nbsp;These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance
            with the laws of the New York and controlling U.S. federal law as
            applicable, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
        </p><p>
            <strong>If you are a resident of the European Union:</strong>&nbsp;These Terms shall be

            Netherlands, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
        </p><h2>14. Disputes and Arbitration, Class Action Waiver, Jurisdiction and Venue</h2><p>If you are a resident of the United States:</p><p><strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong></p><p>
            YOU AND MyFittnesApp AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF
            OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE (A “DISPUTE”) TO BINDING
            ARBITRATION. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and
            MyFittnesApp agrees that any disputes arising out of or related to your
            use of the Services (a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”) will be resolved by binding
            arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the
            United States Code), which shall govern the interpretation and
            enforcement of this arbitration agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”). In
            arbitration, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a
            judge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the
            arbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts. The
            arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief
            as a court, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and
            declaratory relief. Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in
            any court having jurisdiction thereof. Such dispute resolution
            proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a
            class, consolidated or representative action. Except where prohibited,
            you and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of
            Disputes relating to your general use of the Services under the Consumer
            Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Please
            visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;for more information about
            arbitration.
        </p><p>
            Any arbitration between you and us, to the extent necessary, will be
            conducted remotely as provided below.
        </p><p>
            The arbitration will be conducted in English. A single independent and
            impartial arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the rules of the
            American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator will decide all issues
            relating to the enforceability, interpretation, scope, and application
            of this Arbitration Agreement (including “gateway” issues of
            arbitrability, whether the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable or
            illusory and any defense to arbitration), and these Terms, except that a
            court may resolve any question regarding the validity or enforceability
            of the class action waiver set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. The
            term "Dispute" and the requirement to arbitrate will be broadly
            interpreted.&nbsp;
        </p><p>
            Both you and we agree to comply with the following rules, which are
            intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the
            costs and burdens for everyone involved:
        </p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be
                    solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be
                    chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the
                    parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by
                    the parties; and
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
                    in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul><p>
            Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or
            her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.
            The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in
            the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to
            the public and confidential and all records relating thereto will be
            permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of
            the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing
            and will include a statement describing the reasons for the disposition
            of any claim.
        </p><p>
            You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute
            with us arising out of or relating to your choice to maintain an
            account, access or use the Services:
        </p><ul>
            <li><p>You are giving up your right to have a trial by jury;</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You are giving up your right to serve as a representative, as a
                    private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity,
                    or to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any
                    lawsuit involving any such dispute; and
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You must file any claim within one (1) year after such claim arose
                    or it is forever barred.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul><p>
            Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
            governed by the American Arbitration Association’s rules. MyFittnesApp
            will reimburse you for those fees up to $5,000, unless the arbitrator
            determines your claims are frivolous. Likewise, MyFittnesApp will not
            seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator
            determines your claims are frivolous.
        </p><p>
            NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT,
            YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF
            YOU OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE
            EARLIER OF: (1) THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS, OR (2) THE DATE YOU
            FIRST AGREED OR ASSENTED TO AN AGREEMENT WITH MYFITNESS PAL THAT
            CONTAINED AN ARBITRATION PROVISION. The opt-out notice must be
            postmarked no later than the applicable deadline and emailed to:
            legal@MyFittnesApp.com. The opt-out notice must state that you do not
            agree to this Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address,
            phone number and email address. This procedure is the only way you can
            opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and failure to comply strictly
            with this procedure and the applicable deadline automatically will
            render the opt-out notice null and void. If you opt out of the
            arbitration provision, all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement
            will continue to apply.
        </p><p>
            If this arbitration provision is found to be null and void, then all
            disputes arising under the Terms between us will be subject to the
            jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York, New
            York, and you and we hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and
            venue of these courts. You and MyFittnesApp agree that if for any reason
            a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration: (1) you and
            MyFittnesApp waive any right to a jury trial; (2) the Dispute will
            proceed solely on an individual, non-class, non-representative basis;
            and (3) neither you nor MyFittnesApp may be a class representative or
            class member or otherwise participate in any class, representative,
            consolidated, or private attorney general proceeding.
        </p><p>
            This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or MyFittnesApp from
            seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without
            limitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm
            an arbitral award, from a court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore,
            this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or MyFittnesApp from
            (i) applying to the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction for a
            temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or
            conservatory relief, as necessary, or (ii) seeking relief in any state
            or federal court for disputes related to a violation or possible
            violation of MyFittnesApp’s intellectual property rights.

            be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
            endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the
