            Interest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based
            on your web browsing and app usage over time and across websites or
            apps. Our advertising practices also include the creation and use of
            "audience segments." You have the option to restrict the use of
            information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving
            interest-based ads. Depending on where you access our website from, you
            may also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including
            advertising cookies. Additional information on Audience Segments and our
            choices for interest- based advertising is found below.

                    purposes of interest-based advertising, including for third party,
                    interest-based advertising. This processing includes the use of
                    Personal Data to create audience segments. These audience segments
                    are then made available for interest-based advertising, including
                    for third party advertising, on MyFittnesApp online properties. The
                    audience segments are based on website visits, app usage data,
                    Fitness and Wellness Data, online and offline purchasing behaviors,
                    interaction with our ads or marketing emails, similar types of
                    information, and in some cases, data from third parties.

        </p><h3 id="ip-address-use">IP Address Use</h3><p>
            An IP address refers to an identifier assigned by a network to a
            computer, mobile device, Internet of Things (IoT) device, or routing
            device. IP addresses, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, include
            "public" IP addresses, such as the IP address for a home router that is
            visible to the Internet, as well as "local" IP addresses, which are IP
            addresses assigned to computers and mobile devices "behind" a router
            (such as a home router). Our advertising and analytics partners may use
            IP addresses to group or correlate devices for purposes of analytics,
            security and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad
            targeting, ad attribution, and limiting ad frequency.
        </p><p>
            You can choose not to have IP address used for purposes of advertising
            or analytics by using the cookie controls for "Advertising Cookies," and
            "Performance/Analytics," above.
        </p><h3 id="web-pixels-or-beacons-use">Web Pixels or Beacons Use</h3><p>
            Pixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web
            browser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party
            corresponding to the pixel. If that party’s cookies are currently stored
            in your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request.
            Beacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the
            opening of a marketing email. When used in conjunction with cookies for
            interest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to
            control the purpose for which they are used.
        </p><h3 id="html5-local-storage">HTML5 Local Storage</h3><p>
            HTML5 Local Storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be
            used for the same purpose (to pair a tracking ID to a particular web
            server with your web browser so that the web server can identify your
            web browser over time). You can control the purpose for which HTML5
            Local Storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above.
        </p><h3 id="social-network-interaction-and-widgets">Social Network Interaction and Widgets</h3><p>
            Social network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our Website passively
            transmit data regarding a social network’s members to that social
            network, even when a button is not clicked. These technologies may allow
            a social network (e.g., Facebook) to personally identify its members and
            to know the web pages its members have visited. This is true wherever
            social network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is
            "clicked" or "pressed." If you belong to a social network or use these
            categories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of
            those services to understand the nature of the data that they collect
            and what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is
            collected and used. If you disable advertising cookies, the passive
            tracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.

            residents of the European Economic Area with third parties only under

            If you are a resident of California, you have certain rights to the
            Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under California law,
            the exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to
            safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of
            crime) and our interests (e.g., maintaining confidentially when legally
            required ). We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably
            practicable. Requests to exercise your rights may be granted in whole,
            in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request
            and applicable law. To prevent unauthorized access to your Personal
            Data, we take steps to verify an individual’s right to the data -
            including requiring users to reach out to us directly from a verified
            email address, pass a challenge response, and/or confirm information
            associated with the account. Following verification of your identity, we
            will notify you if we are unable to fulfill your request and outline the
            reasons we are unable to honor your request at this time.

                    us for confirmation on whether we are processing your Personal Data,
                    and access to the Personal Data, as permitted by law. This may

                    have the right to opt-out of certain data sharing practices with
                    third parties who may use your Personal Data solely for their own
                    purposes. Your right to opt-out is limited to information we "sell"
                    to these third parties. "Sell" in this case does not mean providing
                    data in exchange for money – <em>we don’t do that.</em> "Sell" instead
                    means the disclosure of data, including technical device data that
                    does not identify you directly, when a third party might use that
                    data for its own purposes, such as for personalized advertising. We
                    do not have actual knowledge that we sell personal information of

        </p><p><strong>Additional California Rights</strong></p><p>
            California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to
            request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Data (if any) we
            disclosed to third parties for that third party’s direct marketing
            purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of
            those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free
            of charge.
        </p><p>
            Under Section 1798.83, we currently do not share any Personal Data with
            third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If we do decide to
            share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing
            purposes, you may opt-out of this disclosure at any time by submitting a
            request to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.MyFittnesApp.com/contact-us">Support Team</a>,
            or in writing to:
        </p><p>MyFittnesApp, Inc.<br>ATTN: Privacy/Legal<br>135 Townsend Street<br>San Francisco, CA 94107</p><p>
            It is important to note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures
            made for non-marketing purposes or for purposes of assisting us with our
            own marketing.
