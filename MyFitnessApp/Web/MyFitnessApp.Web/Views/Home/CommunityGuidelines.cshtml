<h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom text-center">Welcome to MyFitnessApp</h2>

<section class="jss2"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">Welcome to MyFitnessApp! We want our members to feel like this is a safe, friendly, supportive site for people focused on living better and healthier lives. We have a variety of categories you can participate in, ranging from sharing Success Stories to asking about Food and Nutrition to Fitness and Exercise and more.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">Please keep in mind that our message boards are public, and when you make something publicly available on the Internet, it becomes practically impossible to take down all copies of it in the future. If you need help removing your posts, please <a href="https://support.MyFitnessApp.com/hc/articles/360032273952-How-can-I-delete-a-forum-post-" target="_self">click here</a> for more information.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">We have established the following guidelines which we ask all of our members to follow. We strongly feel that posts or actions disregarding these guidelines jeopardize the supportive atmosphere of MyFitnessApp. Use of MyFitnessApp is subject to these Community Guidelines and our Terms of Service.</p></section>

<section class="jss2"><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h2 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">Moderation and Reporting Posts</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">MyFitnessApp is moderated by a team of volunteers and a few full-time site administrators. We do not review content as it is posted, we rely on our members to help us identify problems. If you see a post that you feel violates our guidelines, you can help us by <a href="https://support.MyFitnessApp.com/hc/articles/360032624951-How-do-I-report-inappropriate-forum-posts-or-spam-" target="_self">reporting a post</a>. Our goal is to get to reports as soon as possible; however an actual human does look at each report, and some may take longer than others to decide an outcome.</p></section>

<section class="jss2"><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h2 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">Groups</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">MyFitnessApp Groups allow members with similar interests to communicate separately from the public message boards. Groups are user-moderated and can be private, or visible to other MyFitnessApp members.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">Group content must adhere to our Community Guidelines, including group-specific guidelines.</p></section>

<section class="jss2"><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h2 MuiTypography-paragraph">Play Nice</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-colorPrimary MuiTypography-gutterBottom">I WILL:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I will be respectful and understand that everyone is different. Some members are new to this, so be kind to the newbies.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I will remember the human on the other side of the screen.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I will share my opinions while respecting others' thoughts and feelings as well.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I will be ready to hear and accept other opinions that I might not always agree with.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">I will ignore users</a>.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-colorError MuiTypography-gutterBottom">I WON'T:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I won’t be a jerk.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I won't attack, mock, or otherwise insult others. I can respectfully disagree with the message or topic, but I cannot attack the messenger. This includes attacks against the member’s spelling or command of written English, belittling a member for posting a duplicate discussion, or attacking a member for posting in an older discussion. (ie. It’s lose not loose, strong first post, didn’t you already post this today, etc.) Not every member has the same level of education, so I’ll refrain from criticizing a member for not framing their content in a manner befitting a university-level science paper.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">I won’t pick apart how something is said; I will focus on the meaning/message.</p></section>

<section class="jss2"><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h2 MuiTypography-paragraph">Treat others with dignity, compassion and respect</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-colorPrimary MuiTypography-gutterBottom">I WILL:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I will SHOW RESPECT.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I will show kindness.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">I will respect that MyFitnessApp has a zero-tolerance policy for hate speech.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-colorError MuiTypography-gutterBottom">I WON'T:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I won’t be a bully.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I won’t belittle others.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I won’t make any derogatory references to sex, gender, age, weight, body type, disability, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I won’t stalk other members. This includes stalking a poster through the forums, posting about past events gone sour, divulging personal information, or spreading gossip or rumors.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I won’t make stereotypes against other members.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I won’t post discussions or comments that incite racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm to any individual or group.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1">I won’t endorse violence against any person or group, even if couched in humor.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph">I won’t publicly post information that poses or creates a privacy or security risk to any person (i.e., by publicly posting any person's contact information on the forums).</p></section>
