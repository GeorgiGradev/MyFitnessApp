                        The reason our system is so easy to use is because it learns from you! All of us tend to eat the same foods over time. <strong>MyFitnessApp </strong> remembers what you've eaten and done most often in the past, and makes it easy for you to add those foods again to your log.

                        <strong>So the more you track your meals, the easier it becomes!</strong>
