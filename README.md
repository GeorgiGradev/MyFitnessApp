# MyFitnessApp

## :eyeglasses: Project Introduction
This is my final project from the **ASP.NET Core** course at the **Software University**. It is a ready-to-use **ASP.NET 5.0 MVC** application.
<br/><br/>

## üìù Project Overview
-	**MyFitnessApp** is a ready to use application for fitness and nutrition which is easy to use and has a simple user-friendly interface. The backend is developed with MS SQL and Entity Framework Core, and the frontend is built with Bootstrap (Java Script improvements are comming soon).
-	The application requires a simple registration process. More user information must be filled after the first log-in. Creating a user‚Äôs profile is obligatory and only users with active profiles can enjoy the full functionallity of the application.
-	Users can create and search for foods and exercises but do not have the possibility to edit or delete them due to the fact that other user may already use them. Only the administrator can delete foods and exercises in case they consist of inappropriate content.
-	Users can generate eating and workout plans (diaries) which can be edited and deleted.
-	Users can create, edit, delete, search and see details about forum posts, forum post comments and blog articles. Before deletion a pop up window asks for confirmation
-	Users can follow and unfollow another users. They can also send Emails to another users thanks to the integrated SendGrid client.
-	The administrator has a special Admin Area from where he/she can create, update, delete and see details about users, foods, exercises, articles and forum posts. The administrator can also ban and unban users. A banned user cannot access the full functionallity of the application.
-	The application has preloaded (seeded) user roles, users (admin and user), foods, exercises, exercise categories, exercise equipment, articles, article categories and forum categories.
